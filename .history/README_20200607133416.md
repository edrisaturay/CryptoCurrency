# DAPP Coin

### Dependencies
* Node.js
* Truffle Framework - Tools that allow us to write smart contract - npm install -g truffle
* Ganache - local blockchain
* Metamask Extension - Allowing us to interact with the smart contract

### Setting up your project
truffle init


### Steps
* Create the contract
* Initialise with number of token available passed in the constructor through the migrations
* Allocate the total token to the admin account
* Implement Transfer tokens 
** Trigger an event transfer and return bool true if successful
* Implement Deligated Transfer - Complying with ERC20 Standards 
    * Implement Transfer From - handles the approve function
        * Transfer _value a
    * Impmement the approve function - allow someone to approve another account to spend tokens on their behalf (account a approve account b to spend c amount of token on my account ) like approving exchange to spend or sell your taking
* Implement Allowance - the amount of token you approve to transfer
    * Takes the address of owner and spender and return uint256 remaining
    * Remaining - is the amount which the _spender is still allowed to withdraw from the _owner
* Implement approval event - trigger and log when the approval function is successful

### Interacting with contract 
* Create a migration
* Migrate - truffle migrate --reset
* Open the console to interact with the contract - truffle console
* Get an instance of the token - DappToken.deployed().then(function(i){token = i})

### Testing the smart contract (Mocha Test Framework and Chai)
* Create the test file - test/DappToken.js

### Checking how many tokens u have
* Using ERC20 Formart, the balanceOf function returns the balance of an address
